# OverlayAnalysis
Program for working with overlay analysis.

Application features:
- Allows to perform layer actions (select layers from a shapefile file, remove layers, display and hide layers);
- Allows to perform overlay analysis of layers (creating a buffer of a given size, merging layers, difference of layers).

This is one of my practical work on the subject of geographical information system. 
As a result of the practical work, a desktop application was created to work with buffers. 
ArcGis Runtime SDK 10.2.7.0 libraries were used to implement the project.

The program was created during my fourth-year studies in 2017.
